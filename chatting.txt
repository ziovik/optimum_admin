I can do it right now
for 5 mins
ok
so, let me tell you
we have allcosm, and I put modal in the same file, und?
yes
but, how can I change values in product_name and price in modal?
throught jquery and Javascript
I need to invoke a fucntion which put these values, und?
ok
when I need to do it? when I press on any product, in the moment, when modal is openning, right?
yes
so I can do it, BUT, I don't have enough details in the table, so I need to get aaaal values, form DB, agree?
yes
so I need to send AJAX, agree?
yes
and now look
this is link with product name.. when I press it I invoke onProductClick function, und?
yes
and I pass there pro_id, agreee?
yes
then I send this pro_id throught HttpRequest (AJAX) to server, right?
ok
modal_product - it is just a handler of this request, und?
k
I am getting from request product_id and check it in DB, then I am getting data from DB, and send it to clinet - allcosm
as JSON object, und?
ok.
I am using Product class, und?
save this chat ok
ok
und?
yes
BUT! we need to put other fields in Product und?
It is not enough, do you see?
so, I JSONized this product object and send it to client, und?
ok
if httprequest (AJAX) is ok, I am getting this product in onProductClick() functino, und?
yes
so , now, I can use jQuery to put values from the data from server (Product object)
and put it throught jQuery
und?
yes
here I put value, und?
so i can add other fields like min description
YOU HAVE TO DO IT BY YOURSELF!!!!
und?
remember i need to press the add to cart button in this modal
Добавить в корзину?
yes but i have not done ot.i need copy the codes n put in modal product page?
modal page is the allcosm page!!! don't forget it!
when you press "Добавить в корзину" - it will be another ajax query!!!
it is very simple, man
yes i know im saying we did add to cart before.i will copy the code n include in allcosm ?
if you like
so, I am pushing it into github and disconnect, man, I have to work
thx
bye
